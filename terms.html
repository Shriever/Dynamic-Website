    <h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
    <p><em>Last Updated: December 25, 2024</em></p>

    <p>
      Welcome to the Dynamic Mortgage website (“Site”). These Terms &amp; Conditions 
      (the “Agreement”) govern your use of our Site and services provided by Dynamic Mortgage 
      (referred to as “we,” “us,” or “our”). By accessing or using the Site, you agree to be 
      bound by the terms of this Agreement.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Eligibility &amp; Mortgage Brokerage Compliance</h2>
    <p>
      Our services are intended for individuals who are at least 18 years old. As a licensed

    <h2>2. No Guarantee of Loan Approval</h2>
    <p>
      While we strive to provide accurate information regarding mortgage products, interest rates,

      factors.
